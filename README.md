# Titanic-Survival-US-Births-and-Coffee-Tea-Sales
Data Analysis and Visualization: Titanic Survival, US Births, and Coffee/Tea Sales project

Project Overview
This project encompasses three distinct analyses performed by utilizing Jupyter Notebook and the pandas library, the project explores datasets related to the Titanic survival rates, historical US birth data, and sales of coffee and tea products, employing different pandas methods to extract insights.
Objectives

- Titanic Survival Analysis: Investigate the correlation between the survival rate of passengers and the deck location of their cabins on the Titanic.
- US Births Analysis: Analyze historical US birth data to identify trends in male and female births across decades.
- Coffee and Tea Sales Analysis: Examine the mean cost of coffee and tea products by sales region, adjusting for inflation.

Methodology
Titanic Survival Analysis
- Dropped records without cabin information and non-conforming cabin assignments.
- Focused on the deck of the cabin to analyze its impact on survival rates, ignoring room numbers and accommodating multiple cabin assignments on the same deck.

US Births Analysis
- Utilized pivot tables to aggregate the number of births by sex for each decade, exploring trends in gender birth rates and overall birth rate changes over time.

Coffee and Tea Sales Analysis
- Analyzed the mean cost of each product category by sales region, with data cleanup involving filling missing values with zero and rounding cost figures to two decimal places.

Tools and Technologies

- Python: For programming logic and data manipulation.
- Pandas: For data analysis and manipulation tasks.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation of the analysis process.
 Data Sources

- Titanic dataset: An exploration into the survival rates of passengers based on cabin deck location.
- US Birth Data: Historical birth data from the CDC, examining birth trends by gender and decade.
- Coffee and Tea Sales Data: Sales data for coffee and tea products over a two-year period, focusing on product costs by region.
